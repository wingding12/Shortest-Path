# Shortest Path Comparator

An interactive web application for visualizing and comparing shortest path algorithms with real-time graph manipulation and performance analysis. Features three algorithms spanning 70 years of computer science evolution: **Bellman-Ford (1956)**, **Dijkstra (1959)**, and the groundbreaking **Tsinghua SSSP (2025)**.

This project aims to provide an educational and interactive platform for understanding how different shortest path algorithms work. By offering side-by-side comparisons of three groundbreaking algorithms spanning 70 years of computer science research, users can:

- **Visualize Algorithm Behavior**: See how each algorithm explores graphs differently across different eras
- **Compare Performance**: Analyze metrics like relaxations, heap operations, pivot selections, and recursive partitions
- **Understand Evolution**: Learn how algorithmic thinking has evolved from the 1950s to cutting-edge 2025 research
- **Algorithm Trade-offs**: Master when to use each algorithm:
  - **Bellman-Ford (1956)**: Handles negative weights, detects negative cycles
  - **Dijkstra (1959)**: Optimal for non-negative weights with O(m + n log n) complexity
  - **Tsinghua (2025)**: Revolutionary O(m log^(2/3) n) breakthrough for sparse graphs
